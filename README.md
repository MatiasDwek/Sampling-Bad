# EDA-Worms

Project for the Argentinian university ITBA. It was made with my partner Nicolas Taccone.

The project uses [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/) and Polonet libraries and it's a reimagining of the Worms Armageddon game. We took the liberty of using some of the original images and sounds, provided that this game was for educational purposes. It supports multiplayer via internet connection. To run it on the same machine, open two instances of the game and use the loopback address (127.0.0.1) to connect.

To get an idea of what the game would look like, [this is a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/nAG2Eqh.jpg) of an early build.
