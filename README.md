# Sampling-Bad

Project for the Argentinian university ITBA. It was made with my partner Juli√°n Tachella.

Using a [Breaking Bad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/) theme, the project is a signal sampling simulator for MATLAB. To run the project run pinkman.m script with MATLAB.

To get an idea of what the program looks like, [here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/XJLvpNM.png).
